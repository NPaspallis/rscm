#summary This is a quick guide on how to create a context-aware app for ANDROID using the RSCM middleware

= Introduction =

The RSCM is a middleware for creating context-aware apps for ANDROID, using dynamically discovered components (i.e. context plugins)

= Basics =

Just like when you use the core services for ANDROID for getting context data (say location), similarly in RSCM you need to follow these steps:
  # Get access to the context service
  # Tell the context service the data you are interested in
  # Implement the callback that will handle the notifications
  # Ensure that the app's Manifest file includes the required permissions
