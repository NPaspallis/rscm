#summary This is a quick guide on how to create a context sensor plugin for ANDROID using the RSCM middleware

= Introduction =

Context sensor (and reasoner) plugins are essential components of the RSCM middleware. Instead of packing all context sensing (and reasoning functionality) in a single app, RSCM allows you to define plugins as individual, reusable and dynamically discoverable components.

This page will guide you through the required steps for building a context sensor plugin.

= Basics =

A context plugin is basically an ANDROID Bound service. The required steps are:
  # Define the provided context types
  # Intercept the [http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/bound-services.html bound service lifecycle] methods to register (and unregister) from the underlying context source
  # Create context change notifications
